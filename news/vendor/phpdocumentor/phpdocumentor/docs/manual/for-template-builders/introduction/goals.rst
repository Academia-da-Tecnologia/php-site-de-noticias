With this guide we hope that you become just as excited as we are about creating
templates in phpDocumentor2.

After reading this guide you will be familiar with the following:

* How to create a new template
* How to extend a template from another
* What a writer is and how create your own
* What all configuration settings mean

Should you miss some information, do not hesitate to ask on the `mailing lists`_ or
submit an issue in our `issue tracker`_. We will try to add the information to the
documentation as soon as possible.
