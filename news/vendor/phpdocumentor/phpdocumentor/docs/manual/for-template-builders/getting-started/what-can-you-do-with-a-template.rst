What can you do with a template?
================================

It is the template that transforms all the raw data which is aggregated  by phpDocumentor into an attractive
presentation, or the machine-readable format of your tool of preference.

With templates you can:

* Create HTML files using Twig or XSLT.
* Create HTML based reports with deprecated functions, todo lists and documentation errors.
* Create XML reports, such as Checkstyle error reports.
* Include assets, such as stylesheets, images and javascript files, from your template.
* Generate a Class Diagram.
* And more ..

But there is more! Templates can access files inside one another, which enables you to extend
an existing template without copying the entire thing.

*Given a little creativity there are even more ways to influence the creation of your presentation.*
